- In s2.2 (pg 5) ... what does ≡ mean?

Explain.
DONE

- the type SubEq p1 p2 U1 U2 [defined by the 7 cases] is indeed equivalent to sub p1 U1 ≡ sub p2 U2."
Now has this been proved in Agda?

Prove it.
DONE

- there should be more said to highlight which results have been proved _in Agda_.

Maybe add links to Agda code?
DONE

- S3.1 Cut Admissibility ... That is, the function called cut takes as arguments the two premises (*) of the cut rule and returns a cut-free derivation of the conclusion  ... this point should be made more clearly

Add explicit explanation that the "cut" term is a function taking two derivations and producing a new one, etc etc.

Also explain that this is not cut elimination, since there is no primitive cut rule. And add that one could alternatively start with a sequent calculus with cut (and appropriate extra equivalences in \doteq for cut, e.g. the ones in Fig 1) and define a cut elimination procedure translating derivations in the calculus with cut into derivations in the calculus without cut, that also preserves the equivalences.
DONE

- S4. Equivalence of Derivations ... T |- C is (in logic) a proposition

In our work, a sequent T |- C should be thought as a collection of proofs, and each term f : T |- C is a specific derivation of the sequent.
DONE

- change "equivalent" in the bottom line of pg 11 to
"eq-dot-equivalent"

Change.
DONE

- diagram at the bottom of pg 6: (i) is there a stray T1 there?

Remove.
DONE

- Figures 1,2,3, each with 3 examples, could have more space between the
3 examples in each figure.

Add some space.
DONE

- pg 13, s5, first para: var(D) ⊆ var(Γ0) ∩ var(Γ0, Γ1, C)

Replace with var(D) ⊆ var(Γ1) ∩ var(Γ0, Γ2, C),
DONE

- pg 13, 3rd last line, "of a in inference"

"of an inference"
DONE

Rev 2

- can this formalisation be generalised in a way that it can be applied to nearby logics? Can you make use of this formalisation and existing formalisations of, say, context-free languages, to obtain PTIME membership?

Add a sentence in the end about future work: formalize the relationship with context-free grammars (Buszkowski, Bulinska, others).

Rev 3

- p6, case 2: "an example of tree sub p*2* U2"

Fix, also in the end of p7.
DONE

- p13, l-2: process -> processing

Fix.
DONE

- Craig original paper is not cited while I think this reference would be adequate.

Add.
DONE

- [6] you cite Cubric Arch Math Logic paper but I would suggest also citing his PhD

Add.
DONE

- [10] the reference by Kokke corresponds to a work presented at the 1st Workshop on Type Theory and Lexical Semantics in ESSLLI 2015 -> I would suggest adding this in your reference list.

Fix reference.

DONE

- [14] On Maehara's reference, you translated the name of the journal in english while I think it is more common to use the japanese name of the journal, isn't it.

Change back to Japanese.
DONE

- [20] Saurin's work will appear in FSCD 2025.

Fix.
